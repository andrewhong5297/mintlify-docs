## Datashare 101's

To start leveraging Dune's Datashare on Snowflake for your blockchain analytics needs, visit the Dune profile on the [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune). There are trial tables available. If interested in participating in the trial please refer to our trial guide under [getting started](/datashare/datashare-trial/).

## Dune vs. Datashare

The data we provide on the Snowflake Marketplace is the same data that powers our analytics platform. However, since the data is in a different environment, there are slight differences in the way we need to store the data.

### Datatypes

On Snowflake, the way we store data is different, since there is no native support for common blockchain data types in Snowflake. This affects the way we store addresses, hashes, call data and other varbinary data. Furthermore, high-precisions integers like `uint256` and `int256` are also affected.

### Varbinary Data

For columns that have the datatype `varbinary` in Dune, there are two columns in Snowflake named "column_name" and "column_name_hex" (e.g., hash and hash_hex). "Column_name" is of type `varbinary`, "column_name_hex" is of type `string` and contains the 0x-prefixed lowercase hex representation of the binary data for convenience. For complex queries, it is recommended to use the "column_name" column, as it is more efficient. Snowflake does not support storing `varbinary` data with a `0x` prefix, so we store the data as `varbinary` and provide a `string` column with the hex representation for convenience. Queries using "hash_hex" will be much slower than queries using "hash" due to the data type.


|Database | Column Name | Data Type         | Data Display Sample                                                            |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Dune        | hash        | `varbinary`    | 0xefb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60   |
|Snowflake   | hash        | `varbinary`    | EFB2E2C26974F72D9F3F04C693DB73ECC679DD60  |
|Snowflake   | hash_hex    | `string`       | '0xEfB2E2c26974F72D9f3f04C693DB73eCc679dd60' |


```sql
--Using hash:
select * from ethereum.transactions where hash = X'efb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60'
--Using hash_hex:
select * from ethereum.transactions where hash_hex = LOWER('0xEfB2E2c26974F72D9f3f04C693DB73eCc679dd60') -- Not recommended
```

<Info> Varbinary data in Snowflake is displayed as `ABCDEF` but needs to be queried via `X'abcdef'`. There is a difference between the representation and the actual data. </Info>


### High Precision Integers

For most columns with type `INT256` or `UINT256` in Dune, there are two columns in Snowflake, one of type `DOUBLE`, and one of type `VARBINARY`. The `VARBINARY` column contains the 32-byte, big-endian, 2s complement representation of the INT256 or UINT256 number. The DOUBLE column is named "column_name" while the `VARBINARY` column is usually named "column_name_binary" or "column_name_raw". For most use cases, the `DOUBLE` column is sufficient, but for queries that require exact precision, it is recommended to use the Dune query engine, as it has native support for these data types. 

The `VARBINARY` datatype columns are useful when exact precision is needed, but calculations are not required. For example, if you want to join on `token_id` for erc1155 transfers, you can use the `VARBINARY` column `token_id_binary`. Using double for this would not work, as the precision is not sufficient.
