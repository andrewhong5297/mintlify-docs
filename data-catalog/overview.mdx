Dune provides a comprehensive collection of blockchain data designed for developers, traders, and researchers.
Access our data tables through the **[Dune Web App](/web-app/overview)**, the **[Dune API](api-reference/overview/introduction)**, or the **[Snowflake Data Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune)**.

## Our Data Difference

We are dedicated to building state-of-the-art data infrastructure to deliver the most accurate and complete blockchain data possible. Our catalog features:

- **Rapid Refresh Rates:** Updates from blockchain networks occur within two minutes.
- **Complete Historical Records:** Full and uninterrupted historical data ensure thorough source integrity.
- **Accurate and Validated Data:** Every data point undergoes strict validation for consistency and uniqueness.
- **Rich Data Variety:**  We decode complex data structures into clear, structured information.
- **Community-Curated Insights:** Using Dune's **[Spellbook](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook)**, we enable collaborative, community-driven data modelling to unlock new insights quickly.
- **Extensive Data Pools:** Our active and innovative community contributes to a vast pool of accessible data.
- **Unified, Cross-Chain Data Views:** Easily ompare and analyze data across different blockchain networks.


## Supported Blockcghains
We support a wide range of both EVM-compatible and non-EVM blockchains. 

### EVM-Compatible Chains

Our data catalog covers Ethereum Mainnet and platforms compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)—such as rollups, sidechains, and other Layer 2 solutions—which are designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability:

  - Arbitrum
  - Avalanche C-Chain
  - BNB Chain
  - Base
  - Celo
  - Ethereum
  - Fantom
  - Gnosis Chain
  - Goerli
  - Optimism
  - Polygon
  - Scroll
  - Zora
  - zkSync

### Non EVM Chains

We also provide data for chains outside the Ethereum framework (non-EVM chains), supporting a variety of blockchain architectures:

  - Aptos
  - Bitcoin
  - Solana
  - Polkadot (Substrate)

## How We Choose Blockchains
Our criteria for integrating new blockchains into our catalog include:

  1. **Demand:** We measure community and ecosystem interest in a blockchain.
  2. **Growth Potential:** We evaluate developer activity and user adoption to forecast the blockchain's long-term viability.
  3. **Technical Compatibility:** We assess a blockchain's technical integration feasibility with our infrastructure.
