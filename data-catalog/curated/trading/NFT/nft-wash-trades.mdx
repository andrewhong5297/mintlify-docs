## Mechanism

The nft.wash_trades table employs a multi-faceted approach to identify potential wash trades:

1. Basic Trade Information: Each entry includes details such as blockchain, project, NFT contract address, token ID, buyer, seller, and transaction specifics.

2. Funding Source Analysis: The table tracks the first funding sources for both buyers and sellers (buyer_first_funded_by, seller_first_funded_by) to identify potential connections between trading parties.

3. Wash Trade Filters: Several filters are applied to flag suspicious activities:
   - filter_1_same_buyer_seller: Identifies trades where the buyer and seller are the same.
   - filter_2_back_and_forth_trade: Detects repetitive trading between the same parties.
   - filter_3_bought_or_sold_3x: Flags NFTs that have been traded frequently in a short period.
   - filter_4_first_funded_by_same_wallet: Identifies trades where both parties were initially funded by the same wallet.
   - filter_5_flashloan: Detects trades potentially facilitated by flash loans.

4. Wash Trade Classification: The is_wash_trade column provides a final verdict on whether a trade is considered a wash trade based on the applied filters.

This mechanism allows for a comprehensive analysis of NFT trades, helping to distinguish genuine market activity from potential manipulation.
