The `tokens.erc20` table contains metadata for ERC20 tokens across all EVM-compatible networks indexed on Dune. This dataset provides essential information about ERC20 tokens, including:

- The blockchain on which the token exists
- The contract address of the token
- The token symbol
- The number of decimals used by the token

### Utility

The ERC20 metadata table offers valuable information for token analysis and integration, allowing you to:

- Identify tokens across different blockchains
- Retrieve essential token information for calculations and display
- Cross-reference token data with other tables like `tokens.transfers`

The table contains the following columns:

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="tokens" tableName="erc20" />

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="tokens" tableName="erc20" />

### Token Coverage

We use the [DefinedFi](https://docs.defined.fi/reference/token) token list to index ERC20 tokens. The list is updated on a regular basis and includes tokens that are not native to the chain. The list includes tokens from all EVM-compatible chains, including EVM-compatible sidechains and all layer 2 solutions.

## Sample Queries

**Query ERC20 tokens on a specific blockchain**

This query returns ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain:

```sql
SELECT
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
LIMIT 100
```

**Find tokens with a specific symbol across blockchains**

This query finds all tokens with the symbol "USDC" across different blockchains:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE symbol = 'USDC'
```

**List tokens with non-standard decimal places**

This query lists tokens that don't use the standard 18 decimal places:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE decimals != 18
ORDER BY decimals DESC
LIMIT 50
```
