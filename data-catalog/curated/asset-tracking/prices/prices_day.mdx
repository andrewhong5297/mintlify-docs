# Prices.day

The `prices.day` table provides daily price data for tokens across multiple blockchains, aggregated at 00:00 UTC.

## Table Structure

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana, null for native currencies) |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the token exists      |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The daily price of the asset in USD           |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which this price is reported (00:00 UTC) |

## Usage

This table is ideal for analyzing daily price trends and performing day-over-day comparisons. It provides a good balance between data granularity and query performance for longer-term analyses.

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('month', timestamp) AS month,
    AVG(price) AS average_monthly_price
FROM prices.day
WHERE 
    blockchain = 'ethereum' 
    AND symbol = 'WETH'
    AND timestamp >= DATE '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

This query calculates the average monthly price for WETH on Ethereum for each month since the start of 2023.

## Notes

- Prices are calculated on a per-chain basis.
- For tokens not in the trusted token list, prices may differ across chains.
- Always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification, as `symbol` is not unique.
