description: Latest price data for tokens in USD
---

The `prices.usd_latest` table is a simplified version of `prices.usd`, providing the most recent price data for tokens across various blockchains. This table is designed to enable simpler and faster queries when only the latest price information is needed.

### Key Features

- Contains only the most recent price for each token
- Enables less complex and faster queries compared to `prices.usd`
- Covers the same range of assets as `prices.usd` (EVM networks, Solana, and other L1 blockchains)

### Usage

When you need only the current price of a token, use `prices.usd_latest` instead of `prices.usd`. This eliminates the need for subqueries or complex time-based filters, resulting in simpler and more efficient queries.

Example query:

```sql
SELECT symbol, price 
FROM prices.usd_latest
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND symbol = 'WETH'
```

### Column Descriptions

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | The unique identifier of the token (same as in `prices.usd`) |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The latest price of the asset in USD          |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the asset exists      |

For more detailed information on coverage, adding prices, and unique identifiers, please refer to the documentation for [prices.usd](/data-catalog/curated/asset-tracking/prices/prices).

<Note>
  The `prices.usd_latest` table shares the same data source and update frequency as `prices.usd`, but only stores the most recent price for each token.
