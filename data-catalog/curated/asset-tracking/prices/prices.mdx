description: Price data for erc20 tokens in USD
---

We pull price data from the [coinpaprika](https://coinpaprika.com) API.

The Price is the volume-weighted price based on real-time market data, translated to USD.

### Coverage

This table supports a range of prices for assets on EVM networks and Solana. The table includes prices for the following assets:

- ERC20 tokens
- Native currencies
- Solana tokens 
- other L1 and blockchains with `blockchain = null`


### Adding Prices

If the token you desire is not listed in here, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/models/prices#adding-a-token-to-price-tracking) to add it.

### Unique Identifier

Since the different blockchains have different standards for identifying tokens, we use the following identifiers:

| Blockchain | Identifier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| EVM        | contract address |
| Solana     | mint address in `from_base58` format |
| other L1   | null |

That means if you are querying to solana tokens you need to use the mint address in `from_base58` format.

```sql
Select * from prices.usd 
where blockchain = 'solana'
and contract_address = from_base58('NeonTjSjsuo3rexg9o6vHuMXw62f9V7zvmu8M8Zut44')
limit 100

--this will convert the mint address to how we store it in the table
```


```sql
Select * from prices.usd 
where blockchain is null
and contract_address = '6h6vVc42moDmRs7KahQpFs8YWL5GfWBrxT9UrsUvpApn'
limit 100
```


### Column Descriptions

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | the unique identifier of the token. For ERC20 tokens, this is the contract address. For solana tokens, this is the mint address in `from_base58` format. Since there is no standard for identifying native currencies, this is null. |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | the identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _bigint_    | The price of the asset in any given minute    |
| `minute`           | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which minute this price is reported |

<Note>
  Note that `WETH` has to be used for the ETH price as ETH is not an erc20 token.
