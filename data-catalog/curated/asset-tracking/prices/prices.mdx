# Dune Price Feed

Dune provides comprehensive price data for tokens across multiple blockchains through three main tables:

- `prices.day`
- `prices.hour`
- `prices.minute`

## Coverage

The price feed offers extensive coverage across EVM networks:

- Over 180,000 tokens
- More than 700,000 contract addresses
- Support for 37+ blockchains
- Transparent methodology leveraging Dune's comprehensive DEX trades data set
- Automatic token addition once a $10,000 transfer volume threshold is reached

## Methodology

The price feed combines two main data sources:

1. Token prices for major assets from Coin Paprika
2. Prices derived from Dune's `dex.trades` data for other assets

The process includes several steps to ensure data quality and reduce outliers:

1. Tokens with less than $10,000 USD volume overall are filtered out
2. Token trades are aggregated to the block level, using the median 50th percentile price per block
3. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is calculated for each time aggregation (minute, day, hour)
4. VWAP values exceeding the prior period by more than 1000% are filtered out to avoid outliers
5. Prices are forward-filled until another trade is found, ensuring consistent pricing across time periods

## Important Notes

1. Prices are calculated on a per-chain basis. Tokens not in the [trusted token list](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/dbt_subprojects/tokens/models/prices/prices_trusted_tokens.sql) may have different prices across chains.
2. Prices are calculated at the `contract_address` and `blockchain` level.
3. Token `symbol` is not a unique identifier, as different tokens may share the same symbol.

## Table Structure

The `prices.day`, `prices.hour`, and `prices.minute` tables share the following structure:

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana, null for native currencies) |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the token exists      |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The price of the asset in USD                 |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which this price is reported |

## Legacy Price Tables

Dune maintains older price tables for historical context: `prices.usd`, `prices.usd_daily`, and `prices.usd_latest`. These tables have lower coverage and are no longer updated. Users are encouraged to use the newer `prices.day`, `prices.hour`, and `prices.minute` tables for better coverage and ongoing support.

### Legacy Coverage

- Approximately 2,800 tokens
- Around 3,600 contract addresses
- 63% of transfers with price coverage
- Support for 22 blockchains
- Manual token addition process

### Legacy Data Source

Price data for legacy tables is pulled from the [coinpaprika](https://coinpaprika.com) API. The price is the volume-weighted price based on real-time market data, translated to USD.

### Legacy Table Structure

The `prices.usd` table structure:

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana in `from_base58` format, null for native currencies) |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _bigint_    | The price of the asset in any given minute    |
| `minute`           | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which minute this price is reported |

### Legacy Unique Identifier

Different blockchains use different standards for identifying tokens:

| Blockchain | Identifier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| EVM        | contract address |
| Solana     | mint address in `from_base58` format |
| other L1   | null |

For querying Solana tokens, use the mint address in `from_base58` format:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prices.usd 
WHERE blockchain = 'solana'
AND contract_address = from_base58('NeonTjSjsuo3rexg9o6vHuMXw62f9V7zvmu8M8Zut44')
LIMIT 100
```

For other L1 blockchains:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prices.usd 
WHERE blockchain IS NULL
AND contract_address = '6h6vVc42moDmRs7KahQpFs8YWL5GfWBrxT9UrsUvpApn'
LIMIT 100
```

<Note>
  Note that `WETH` has to be used for the ETH price as ETH is not an ERC20 token.
