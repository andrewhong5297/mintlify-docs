# Prices.minute

The `prices.minute` table provides the most granular price data for tokens across multiple blockchains, updated every minute.

## Table Structure

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana, null for native currencies) |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the token exists      |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The price of the asset in USD for each minute |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which this price is reported |

## Usage

This table is ideal for high-frequency analysis and examining short-term price movements. It's particularly useful for studying price impacts of specific events or transactions.

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    price
FROM prices.minute
WHERE 
    blockchain = 'ethereum' 
    AND symbol = 'WETH'
    AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR
ORDER BY timestamp
```

This query retrieves minute-by-minute prices for WETH on Ethereum for the past hour.

## Notes

- Due to its high granularity, queries on this table may be more resource-intensive. Consider using `prices.hour` or `prices.day` for longer time ranges or if minute-level precision is not required.
- As with all price tables, always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification.
- The minute-level data is particularly useful for analyzing price impacts of specific transactions or events with high temporal precision.
