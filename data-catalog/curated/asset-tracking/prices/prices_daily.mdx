description: Daily price data for tokens in USD
---

The `prices.usd_daily` table is an aggregated version of `prices.usd`, providing daily price data for tokens across various blockchains. This table is designed to enable simpler and faster queries when daily price information is needed.

### Key Features

- Contains daily price data for each token
- Enables less complex and faster queries for daily analyses compared to `prices.usd`
- Covers the same range of assets as `prices.usd` (EVM networks, Solana, and other L1 blockchains)

### Usage

When you need daily price data for tokens, use `prices.usd_daily` instead of `prices.usd`. This eliminates the need for complex time-based aggregations, resulting in simpler and more efficient queries for daily price analysis.

Example query:

```sql
SELECT day, symbol, price
FROM prices.usd_daily
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND symbol = 'WETH'
  AND day >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE) - INTERVAL '1' MONTH
ORDER BY day DESC
```

### Column Descriptions

| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | The unique identifier of the token (same as in `prices.usd`) |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag)                |
| `price`            | _double_    | The closing price of the asset in USD for the day            |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the asset exists                     |
| `day`              | _date_      | The day for which the price is reported                      |

For more detailed information on coverage, adding prices, and unique identifiers, please refer to the documentation for [prices.usd](/data-catalog/curated/asset-tracking/prices/prices).

<Note>
  The `prices.usd_daily` table shares the same data source as `prices.usd`, but
  aggregates the data to a daily level, providing the closing price for each
  day.
