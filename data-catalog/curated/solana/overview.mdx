## Overview

Dune provides curated data tables for the Solana blockchain that make it easier to analyze and understand Solana blockchain activity. These tables are built and maintained by Dune and the community to provide clean, standardized data that's ready for analysis.

## Available Datasets

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Asset Tracking" icon="piggy-bank" href="/data-catalog/curated/solana/asset-tracking">
    Track tokens, NFTs and their movements across the Solana network:
    - Token accounts and balances
    - Token transfers
    - NFT transfers and metadata
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trading" icon="chart-line" href="/data-catalog/curated/solana/trading">
    Analyze trading activity on Solana DEXs:
    - DEX trades across protocols
    - Jupiter aggregator trades
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Asset Tracking Tables

The asset tracking tables provide comprehensive data about tokens and NFTs on Solana:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `solana.token_accounts` | Current state of all SPL token accounts |
| `solana.token_metadata` | Metadata for SPL tokens including name, symbol, etc. |
| `solana.token_transfers` | Transfer events for SPL, Token22 tokens and native SOL transfers |
| `solana.nft_metadata` | Metadata for Solana NFTs |
| `solana.nft_transfers` | Transfer events for Solana NFTs |

## Trading Tables

The trading tables capture decentralized exchange activity:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `solana.dex_trades` | Trades across Solana DEX protocols |
| `solana.jupiter_trades` | Trades routed through Jupiter aggregator |

## Example Query

Here's a simple query to get started analyzing Solana token transfers:

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_transfers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT from_address) as unique_senders
FROM solana.token_transfers
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

## Coverage and Limitations

The Solana curated tables aim to provide comprehensive coverage of on-chain activity, but there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Token and NFT transfers are captured through standard SPL token program events
- Some non-standard token implementations may not be fully captured
- DEX coverage includes major protocols but may not capture all DEX activity
- Data is typically available with a short delay after on-chain finality

For the most up-to-date coverage information, please check the documentation for each specific table.
