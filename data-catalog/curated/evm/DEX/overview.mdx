Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling permissionless trading of tokens directly on-chain. Dune provides comprehensive coverage of DEX activity through curated tables that capture trades, aggregator usage, and MEV events like sandwich attacks. These datasets enable analysis of trading volumes, liquidity dynamics, price impact, and market manipulation across major DEX protocols and networks.
