## Overview

Dune provides curated data tables for EVM networks that make it easier to analyze and understand blockchain activity. These tables are built and maintained by Dune and the community to provide clean, standardized data that's ready for analysis across multiple EVM-compatible networks.

## Asset Tracking Tables

The asset tracking tables provide comprehensive data about tokens and NFTs:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tokens.transfers` | Transfer events for ERC20 tokens and native currencies |
| `tokens.erc20` | Metadata for ERC20 tokens including name, symbol, decimals |
| `tokens_<chain>.balances` | Current token balances by address |
| `nft.transfers` | Transfer events for ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens |

## DEX Tables

The DEX tables capture decentralized exchange activity:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dex.trades` | Individual trades across DEX protocols |
| `dex_aggregator.trades` | Trades routed through aggregators |
| `dex.sandwiches` | Detected sandwich attack trades |
| `dex.sandwiched` | Victims of sandwich attacks |

## NFT Market Tables

The NFT tables track NFT market activity:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `nft.trades` | NFT sales across marketplaces |
| `nft.mints` | NFT minting events |
| `nft.wash_trades` | Detected wash trading activity |

## Example Query

Here's a simple query to analyze daily DEX trading volume:

```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_trades,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1
```

import { QueryContainer } from "/snippets/query-container.mdx";

<QueryContainer queryText="SELECT blockchain, date_trunc('day', block_time) as date, COUNT(*) as num_trades, SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd FROM dex.trades WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1" />

## Coverage and Limitations

The EVM curated tables aim to provide comprehensive coverage of on-chain activity, but there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Token transfers are captured through standard ERC20/721/1155 events
- Some non-standard token implementations may not be fully captured
- DEX coverage includes major protocols but may not capture all DEX activity
- Data is typically available with a short delay after on-chain finality
- Coverage may vary by chain and protocol

For the most up-to-date coverage information, please check the documentation for each specific table.
