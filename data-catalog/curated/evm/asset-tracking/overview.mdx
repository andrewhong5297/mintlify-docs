Blockchain networks have become popular platforms for creating, managing, and trading digital assets. These assets are often represented as tokens, which can be transferred between addresses and owned by users. Dune provides comprehensive asset tracking capabilities across multiple blockchain networks through prepared tables that simplify the process of monitoring and analyzing assets on corresponding networks.
