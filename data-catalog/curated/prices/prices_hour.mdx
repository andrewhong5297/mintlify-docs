# Prices.hour

The `prices.hour` table provides hourly price data for tokens across multiple blockchains.

## Table Structure

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana, null for native currencies) |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the token exists      |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The hourly price of the asset in USD          |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which this price is reported |

## Usage

This table is useful for intraday analysis and tracking price movements with higher granularity than daily data. It's suitable for examining price patterns within a day or across multiple days.

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
    contract_address,
    blockchain,
    symbol,
    price,
    timestamp
FROM prices.hour
```

## Notes

- Hourly data provides a good balance between granularity and query performance for short to medium-term analyses.
- As with all price tables, always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification.
