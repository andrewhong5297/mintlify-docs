# Prices USD Latest (Legacy)

<Warning>
    While this table remains functional for existing tokens, no new tokens will be added. For complete coverage including new tokens, please use `prices.minute`, `prices.hour`, or `prices.day` tables instead.
</Warning>

The `prices.usd_latest` table is a legacy table that was previously used for latest price data. While still accessible for historical purposes, new queries should use the modern price tables.

## Modern Alternatives

For current price data, use:
- `prices.minute` for real-time prices
- `prices.hour` for hourly aggregates
- `prices.day` for daily prices

Example query using modern tables:

```sql
-- For latest prices, use prices.minute with recent timestamp
SELECT
    symbol,
    price
FROM prices.minute
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
    AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
    AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1
```

## Legacy Table Structure
