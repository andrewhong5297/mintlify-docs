# Price Tables

Dune provides price data at multiple time resolutions to balance query performance and data granularity. Choose the appropriate table based on your needs:

- Use `prices.minute` for real-time analysis and examining short-term price movements
- Use `prices.hour` for intraday patterns and medium-term trends
- Use `prices.day` for long-term analysis and optimal query performance

For best performance, use the table with the coarsest granularity that meets your analytical needs. Querying minute-level data over long time periods can be resource-intensive.

## Available Tables

| Table | Granularity | Update Frequency | Aggregation Time |
|-------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| `prices.minute` | 1 minute | Real-time | Current minute |
| `prices.hour` | 1 hour | Hourly | Start of hour |
| `prices.day` | 1 day | Daily | 00:00 UTC |

## Schema

All price tables share the following schema:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Token identifier (ERC20 contract address, Solana mint address, null for natives) |
| `blockchain` | _varchar_ | Network identifier |
| `symbol` | _varchar_ | Token symbol |
| `price` | _double_ | USD price |
| `timestamp` | _timestamp_ | Price timestamp |

## Data Sources & Processing

### Step 1: Trusted Token Prices
1. Source: Coin Paprika API
2. Covers major tokens defined in `prices.trusted_tokens`
3. Used as base prices for DEX pair calculations

### Step 2: DEX-Derived Prices
1. Raw trade data from `dex.trades`
2. Token pairs priced against trusted tokens
3. Processing pipeline:
   - Filter trades with < $10,000 USD total volume
   - Calculate median price per block (50th percentile)
   - Derive USD prices using trusted token prices as base
   - Compute VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) per interval
   - Remove outliers (>1000% change from previous period)
   - Forward-fill gaps until next valid trade

### Example
For a USDC/TOKEN pair:
1. Get USDC price from trusted tokens
2. Use DEX trade `amount_usd` = amount_token * trusted_token_price
3. Apply processing pipeline to calculate final TOKEN price

## Coverage

- 180,000+ unique tokens
- 700,000+ contract addresses
- 20+ blockchains
- Automatic inclusion of new tokens exceeding $10k volume threshold
- Coverage relies on `dex.trades` integration

## Technical Notes

- Prices are calculated independently per blockchain
- Prices are aggregated across all liquidity pools per blockchain
- Token identification requires both `contract_address` AND `blockchain`
- `symbol` is not unique - do not use for token identification





## Legacy Tables

The following tables are maintained for historical compatibility but are no longer updated:
- `prices.usd`
- `prices.usd_daily`
- `prices.usd_latest`

Legacy coverage: ~2,800 tokens, ~3,600 contract addresses, 22 blockchains
