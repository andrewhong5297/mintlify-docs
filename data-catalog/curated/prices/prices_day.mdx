# Prices.day

The `prices.day` table provides daily price data for tokens across multiple blockchains, aggregated at 00:00 UTC.
For details on price calculation methodology, including VWAP calculations and outlier filtering, see the [Prices Overview](/data-catalog/curated/prices/overview#methodology).

## Table Structure

| Column name        | Data type   | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Unique identifier of the token (contract address for ERC20, mint address for Solana, null for native currencies) |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | The blockchain on which the token exists      |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | The identifier of the asset (ticker, cashtag) |
| `price`            | _double_    | The daily price of the asset in USD           |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | The timestamp for which this price is reported (00:00 UTC) |

## Usage

This table is ideal for analyzing daily price trends and performing day-over-day comparisons. It provides a good balance between data granularity and query performance for longer-term analyses.

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT
    contract_address,
    blockchain,
    symbol,
    price,
    timestamp
FROM prices.day
WHERE
    blockchain = 'ethereum'
    AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
    AND timestamp >= DATE '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY timestamp asc
```

## Notes

- Prices are calculated on a per-chain basis.
- For tokens not in the trusted token list, prices may differ across chains.
- Always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification, `symbol` is not unique.
- For details on price calculation methodology, including VWAP calculations and outlier filtering, see the [Prices Overview](/data-catalog/curated/prices/overview#methodology).
