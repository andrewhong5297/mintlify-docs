# Prices USD (Legacy)


<Warning>
    While this table remains functional for existing tokens, no new tokens will be added. For complete coverage including new tokens, please use `prices.minute`, `prices.hour`, or `prices.day` tables instead.
</Warning>

The `prices.usd` table provides historical price data for a fixed set of tokens. While the table continues to update for existing tokens, new tokens will only be added to the modern price tables.

## Modern Alternatives

For complete token coverage, use:
- `prices.day` for daily historical prices
- `prices.hour` for hourly historical data
- `prices.minute` for granular historical data

Example query using modern tables:

```sql
-- For historical prices, use prices.day
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    symbol, 
    price 
FROM prices.day
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
    AND symbol = 'WETH'
    AND timestamp >= DATE '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC
```
