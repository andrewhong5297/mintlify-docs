description: Understanding gas fees as a component of the Dune Index
---

## Overview

Gas fees are a key indicator of blockchain demand and form one of the three core components of the Dune Index. They represent the actual costs users are willing to pay to use blockchain networks.

## Why Gas Fees Matter

Gas fees are valuable as an adoption metric because:
- They represent actual cost users are willing to pay
- Are difficult to artificially inflate
- Provide direct measure of blockspace demand

## Limitations

While gas fees are a strong indicator, they have some limitations:
- Networks become more efficient over time
- Fees may decline even as adoption grows
- Different chains have different fee structures

## Retail Store Analogy

In the retail store analogy, gas fees represent the cost of doing business:
- Operating costs
- Transaction processing fees
- Infrastructure costs

## Interpretation

When analyzing gas fees:
- Look for sustained periods of high fees indicating strong demand
- Consider the relationship with transaction count
- Account for network upgrades that may affect fee structures
