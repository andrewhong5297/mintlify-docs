## Overview

Net USD transferred measures the actual movement of value across blockchain networks. This metric is calculated by determining the net value changes for holders in transactions.

## Why Net Transfers Matter

Net transfers are crucial because they:
- Calculate net value changes for holders in transactions
- Filter out artificial volume
- Provide perspective on meaningful value transfer
- Help distinguish between genuine activity and wash trading

## Calculation Method

Net transfers are calculated by:
1. Tracking value movements between addresses
2. Calculating the net change in value for each holder
3. Filtering out circular transactions
4. Converting to USD value for standardization

## Retail Store Analogy

In the retail store analogy, net transfers represent:
- Money changing hands
- Returns subtracted from total sales
- Actual revenue generated

## Interpretation

When analyzing net transfers:
- Look for sustained periods of high net transfer volume
- Compare against total transfer volume to identify potential wash trading
- Consider the relationship with transaction count and gas fees
