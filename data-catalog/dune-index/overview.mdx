## What is the Dune Index?

The Dune Index is a comprehensive indicator of blockchain adoption that:
- Provides the only comprehensive adoption metric in the industry
- Grows as the industry grows, with new blockchains and adoption being additive
- Combines multiple metrics to give a holistic view of blockchain usage

## Why the Dune Index?

The Dune Index was created because:
- Technology needs adoption to have real-world impact
- Successful products require careful monitoring of traction
- Traditional metrics like TVL and active addresses have limitations
- The industry needed a comprehensive view beyond individual dashboards

## Components

The Dune Index consists of three carefully selected metrics that together provide a comprehensive view of blockchain adoption:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Gas Fees" icon="gas-pump" href="/data-catalog/dune-index/gas-fees">
    Measures willingness to pay for blockspace
  </Card>
  <Card title="Net USD Transferred" icon="money-bill-transfer" href="/data-catalog/dune-index/net-transfers">
    Tracks genuine value movement
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transactions" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" href="/data-catalog/dune-index/transactions">
    Indicates breadth of usage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why These Components?

These three metrics were chosen because they:
1. Complement each other's strengths and weaknesses
2. Are difficult to artificially inflate when considered together
3. Capture different aspects of blockchain usage
4. Provide a retail store analogy:
   - Gas Fees = Cost of doing business
   - Net Transfers = Money changing hands (minus returns)
   - Transactions = Store activity

## Using the Index

The Dune Index can be used in several ways:

## Excluded Metrics

### TVL (Total Value Locked)
TVL was not included because it:
- Can be inflated by whales
- Doesn't account for capital efficiency
- Increases with price regardless of activity
- Is DeFi-centric

### Active Addresses
Active addresses were excluded because:
- Users typically have multiple addresses
- Bots can create unlimited addresses
- Raw address counts don't indicate meaningful activity
