## Overview

Transaction count helps contextualize other metrics by showing the overall level of activity on blockchain networks. It provides insight into how broadly the network is being used.

## Why Transactions Matter

Transaction counts are important because they show:
- Overall activity levels
- Whether transfers and fees correspond to broad or narrow usage
- Growth or decline in network usage
- Network utilization patterns

## Context with Other Metrics

Transactions provide important context when combined with:
- Gas Fees: High fees with few transactions might indicate congestion
- Net Transfers: High transfers with few transactions might indicate large value movements
- Both: Help identify whether activity is broad-based or concentrated

## Retail Store Analogy

In the retail store analogy, transactions represent:
- Number of customer visits
- Individual purchases
- Overall store activity

## Interpretation

When analyzing transactions:
- Look for sustained growth in transaction count
- Consider the relationship with gas fees and net transfers
- Account for different transaction types and their significance
- Monitor for unusual patterns that might indicate artificial activity
