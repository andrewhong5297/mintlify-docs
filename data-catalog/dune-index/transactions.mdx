description: Understanding transactions as a component of the Dune Index
---

## Overview

Transaction count is the simplest and most straightforward component of the Dune Index. It represents the raw number of transactions processed by blockchain networks, providing a clear measure of overall network activity.

## Why Raw Transaction Count?

Using the total transaction count without filtering provides several benefits:
- Simple and transparent methodology
- Easy to verify and reproduce
- Consistent across different chains
- Direct measure of network usage

## Context with Other Metrics

Raw transaction count provides important context when combined with:
- Transaction Fees: High fees with few transactions indicates congestion
- Net Transfers: High transfers with few transactions suggests large value movements
- Both: Helps identify whether activity is broad-based or concentrated

## Interpretation

When analyzing transaction count:
- Look for sustained growth in transaction volume
- Consider the relationship with other metrics
- Compare across different time periods
- Monitor for unusual spikes or drops in activity
