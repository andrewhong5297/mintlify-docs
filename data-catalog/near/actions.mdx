## Table Description

The `near.actions` table contains comprehensive data related to transactions on the NEAR blockchain, including transaction metadata like `block_date` and `tx_hash`, execution statuses, receipts, and detailed action information when applicable.

In NEAR, a transaction can consist of one or more actions, signed by the sender's account and executed by the network. These actions may involve token transfers, smart contract invocations, staking, and more. 

NEAR employs a unique transaction lifecycle where transactions are validated on the sender's shard, converted into receipts, and processed on the receiver's shard. This approach ensures efficient handling of cross-shard communication and data flow.
