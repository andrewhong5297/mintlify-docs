## Table description

This table captures the output generated during the execution of smart contracts. They record key events and actions, such as token transfers or function calls, and are used for tracking, debugging, and monitoring contract activity. Logs help developers understand what happened during a transaction, making it easier to analyze and troubleshoot smart contract behavior.
