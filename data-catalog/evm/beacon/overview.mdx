The Ethereum **Beacon Chain** is the backbone of Ethereum's transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Launched on December 1, 2020, it introduced PoS to the Ethereum ecosystem, enhancing security, scalability, and energy efficiency.

**Key Features:**

- **Proof-of-Stake Consensus:** The Beacon Chain manages a registry of validators who propose and attest to new blocks, replacing the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work system.

- **Validator Coordination:** It coordinates validators, ensuring the network's security and proper functioning by assigning responsibilities and managing rewards and penalties.

- **Foundation for Sharding:** The Beacon Chain lays the groundwork for future scalability improvements, such as sharding, which will enable the network to process more transactions concurrently.

**Data Catalog**

Explore the following datasets to gain insights into the Beacon Chain's operations:



<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attestations" href="./attestations">
    Records of validator attestations, which are votes for a specific block, contributing to consensus and chain finality.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Attester Slashings" href="./attester-slashings">
    Details of penalties imposed on validators who have violated protocol rules by signing conflicting attestations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blob Sidecars" href="./blobs">
    Data related to blob sidecars, which are auxiliary data structures associated with blocks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Blocks" href="./blocks">
    Information on Beacon Chain blocks, including proposer details, parent roots, and state roots.
  </Card>
  <Card title="BLS to Execution Changes"  href="./bls-to-execution-changes">
    Records of changes from BLS public keys to execution addresses, facilitating validator withdrawals.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deposits" href="./deposits">
    Details of ETH deposits made by validators to join the Beacon Chain and participate in staking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Epoch Summaries"  href="./epoch-summaries">
    Summarized data for each epoch, providing insights into validator performance and network health.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Operators"  href="./operators">
    Information about staking operators managing validator nodes on the Beacon Chain.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Proposer Slashings"  href="./proposer-slashings">
    Details of penalties imposed on validators who have proposed conflicting blocks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validator Day Summaries"  href="./validator-day-summaries">
    Daily summaries of validator activities, balances, and performance metrics.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voluntary Exits"  href="./voluntary-exits">
    Records of validators voluntarily exiting the active set, ceasing their participation in consensus duties.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Withdrawals"  href="./withdrawals">
    Information on ETH withdrawals by validators from the Beacon Chain to the execution layer.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These datasets provide a comprehensive view of the Beacon Chain's functionality, validator activities, and the overall health of Ethereum's PoS consensus layer.
