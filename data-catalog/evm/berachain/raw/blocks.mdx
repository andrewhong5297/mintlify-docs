## Table Description

The `berachain.blocks` table contains information about blocks in the Berachain blockchain. Each block contains a collection of transactions that are hashed and added to the blockchain. Berachain uses CometBFT consensus through BeaconKit, providing single slot finality (SSF) for faster and more secure block confirmations.
