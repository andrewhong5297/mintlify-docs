Boba is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) optimistic rollup that offers fast transactions and low fees. It is EVM-compatible, allowing developers to easily deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts on Boba. Some key features of Boba include:

- **Fast Transactions:** Boba provides fast transaction confirmations by leveraging optimistic rollups, enabling high throughput and scalability.

- **Low Fees:** By processing transactions off-chain and only posting data back to Ethereum for finality, Boba offers significantly lower transaction fees compared to Ethereum mainnet.

- **EVM Compatibility:** Boba is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy existing Ethereum smart contracts without modifications.

- **Security:** Boba inherits the security of Ethereum by leveraging fraud proofs and a challenge period to ensure the validity of state transitions.
