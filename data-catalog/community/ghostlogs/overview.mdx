# GhostLogs
[GhostLogs](https://ghostlogs.xyz) - add and emit gasless events from Smart Contracts.

Are you working with Smart Contracts that don't emit necessary event logs? With GhostLogs,
you can modify any deployed contract to emit gasless events and then export those logs
to Dune tables. After that you'll be able to query and join with other native
tables to create dashboards.
