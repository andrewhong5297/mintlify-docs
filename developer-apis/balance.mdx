title: 'Token Balances'
openapi: 'GET /beta/balance/{address}'
---

The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported blockchains (EVM currently).
Data is typically available within 100 ms since a block was propagated to nodes.

<Note>
  - These endpoints are authenticated with a normal Dune API key.
  - As we are in beta there might be changes. Please reach out to realtimeAPI@dune.com if you use this API.
  - Specify `?all_chains` to get native balances for a long tail of evm chains, where we don't support erc20 assets. See [chains endpoint](./chains).
  - Specify `?filters=erc20` or `?filters=native` to get only erc20 tokens or native assets, respectively
  - Specify `?exclude_spam_tokens` to filter out tokens Dune believes to be spam. We use [this query](https://dune.com/queries/3804603) to determine if something is spam.
  - Specify `?chain_ids=11,250,1` to fetch balances only for select chains. See chainlist https://chainlist.org/ for a list of chainIDs.
  - CoinMarketCap is used for price information
  - Token metadata, such as symbols and decimals, are fetched from Dune's tokens.erc20 dataset which is curated by Dune users and [defined.fi](https://defined.fi)

# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size. 
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size. 
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
