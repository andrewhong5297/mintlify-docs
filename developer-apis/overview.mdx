<Note> 
These endpoints are in beta and accessible on a free-trial basis.

Duneâ€™s realtime APIs makes building multi-chain application seamless. We've worked hard to offer incredible multichain support (25+ networks in a single call)
with one the industry's lowest latencies. While these APIs are in beta they power several of the best teams building crypto.

The available APIs are:

1. [Token Balances](./balance): Access accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across EVM blockchains.


## Getting started
In order to get started, all you need is an API key. See [here](/api-reference/overview/authentication#generate-an-api-key) how to generate one.
The API key should always be sent in the header `x-dune-api-key`.


## Getting in touch
Please reach out to at realtimeapi@dune.com for support, custom rate limits or feature requests. We'd be more than happy to help.
