Dune Echo makes building multi-chain application seamless. We've worked hard to offer incredible multichain support (25+ networks in a single call)
with one of the industry's lowest latencies. These APIs power several of the best teams building on crypto.

## Available APIs:

### EVM

1. [Token Balances](./evm/balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./evm/transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across EVM blockchains.

### SVM

<Note>
These endpoints are currently in beta.
</Note>

1. [Token Balances](./svm/balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of native, SPL and SPL-2022 tokens of accounts on SVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./svm/transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across SVM blockchains.

## Getting started
In order to get started, all you need is an API key. See [here](/api-reference/overview/authentication#generate-an-api-key) how to generate one.
The API key should always be sent in the header `x-dune-api-key`.
