title: 'Dune Developer APIs (Beta)'
---

Duneâ€™s realtime developer APIs makes building multi-chain application seemless. 

The APIs available today are:

1. [Token Balances API](./balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions API](./transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across EVM blockchains.

<Note> 
- These endpoints are in beta and accessible on a free-trial basis, please contact realtimeAPI@dune.com to inquire about our roadmap and support questions;
</Note>
<Tip>
    - Currently, the token balances supports 22 EVM-compatible chains. See the [chains Endpoint](./chains) for a list of the supported blockchains.
