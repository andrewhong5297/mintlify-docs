title: 'Hosted Blockchain Integration'
---

Blockchain integration is available through either a "Fully Managed" option or a "Hosted" option. The "Hosted" option allows you to upload your blockchain data to Dune using dedicated blockchain endpoints.

<Note> 
- These endpoints are available only on **enterprise plan**. For access, please contact sales@dune.com.
- There is **no** credit consumption involved in these endpoints. The cost model is different from our other API endpoints.
</Note>

"Hosted" option includes three primary endpoints for blockchain integration:
- [Insert endpoint](./insert): Uploads blockchain data to supported raw tables (`blocks`, `transactions`, `logs`, `traces`) with predefined schemas.
- [Clear endpoint](./clear): Removes all data in a blockchain table.
- Delete endpoint: Eliminates specific rows within a table, offering more granularity than the `Clear` endpoint. (_Currently unavailable_)

<Tip>
    - Currently, the endpoints support only EVM-compatible chains.
    - Dune accepts any data source, provided it conforms to the predefined schemas of the `Insert` endpoint.
    - These endpoints accommodate micro-batch uploads with sub-second processing times and a maximum batch size of approximately 1.2GB â€” suitable for chains with block times of 1-2 seconds.
