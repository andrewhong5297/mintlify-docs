<Warning>
This endpoint is currently in beta, and may change without warning.
</Warning>

To be able to insert into a table, it must have been created with the [/create endpoint](./create).

<Note>
- The data in the files must conform to the schema, and must use the same column names as the schema.
- One successful `/insert` request consumes 10 credits.
</Note>

## Supported filetypes
### CSV files (`Content-Type: text/csv`)
CSV files must use a comma as delimiter, and the column names in the header must match the column names of the table.

### JSON files (`Content-Type: application/x-ndjson`)
These are files where each line is a complete JSON object which creates one table row.
Each line must have keys that match the column names of the table.
