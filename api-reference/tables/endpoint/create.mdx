<Warning>
This endpoint is currently in beta, and may change without warning.
</Warning>

The resulting table will be empty, and can be inserted into with the [/insert endpoint](./insert).

<Note>
- A table must currently be created as public. If the request tries to create a private table, it will fail.
- If a table already exists with the same name, the request will fail.
- Column names in the table can't start with a special character or a digit.
- To delete a table, you must go to `user settings (dune.com) -> data -> delete`.
- Creating a table does not incur credits.
</Note>
