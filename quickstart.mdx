## Welcome to Dune

This guide will fast-track your introduction to **querying**, **visualizing**, and **sharing** blockchain data on Dune. Let's get started!

Dune has many more features, but these are the basics you'll need to get started. If you're looking for more advanced guides, check out the [Analytics Guidelines](/learning-resources) and [Data Tables](/data-catalog/) sections.

### **Prerequisites:**

*   **Dune Account:** You‚Äôll need an active Dune account to follow along. If you don‚Äôt already have one, [sign up here](https://dune.com/auth/register).
*   **Basic Knowledge:** A basic understanding of SQL and blockchain concepts will enhance your experience.

## Query blockchain data

Start by extracting the data you need:

### 1.  **Create a new query** 
Open the query editor in the Dune interface:

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/gT2ctqjvwIuX5xUXPx5S?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Dashboards"
  />
</div>

### 2.  Write SQL
We can enter the following SQL to analyze daily activity on Ethereum:

```sql
--Query to get Ethereum's unique daily active users and passive users  in 2023

SELECT  
--truncate time to day
date_trunc('day', block_time) AS time,
-- count distinct addresses that sent a transactions
COUNT(distinct "from") AS users,
-- count distinct addresses that received a transaction
COUNT(distinct "to") AS receiving_addresses
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time > DATE '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
```

### 3.  Run and save your query
Execute your query and save it for ongoing analysis.

## Create a visualization

To create a visualization you'll need to:

### 1.  Create a new visualization
In our example below, we'll create a line chart to visualize the number of unique daily active users and passive users on Ethereum in 2023.
### 2.  Select the type of visualization you want to create
### 3.  Choose the data source for the x and y axis
We format the axis label and tick label to `0a`to make the numbers more readable.
### 4.  Adjust the visualization settings



<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/nNxDjw8vBmp34u3aNU0R?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Dashboards"
  />
</div>

## Present your data

Share your insights by creating a dashboard:

### 1.  Create a new dashboard
### 2.  Add a visualization to the dashboard
### 3.  Adjust the layout of the dashboard
### 4.  Name and save the dashboard

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/xTAXmlo0nCL0FOn38hW9?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Creating a dashboard"
  />
</div>

## Recap

**Congratulations, you've just queried blockchain data, created a visualization, and presented your data on Dune!**

You can now share your dashboard with the world.
