title: 'Token Prices (Beta)'
openapi: 'GET /echo/beta/prices/evm/{address}'
---

This endpoint returns current USD prices for any ERC20 token contract address. It also prices native tokens--put `native` rather than an address.

Specify `?chain_ids=all` to fetch balances for all supported chains or `?chain_ids=11,250,1` to fetch balances only for select chains. 

<Note>
As we are in beta there might be changes. Please reach out to us using [this form](https://forms.gle/8qmnUZ6ZwzRFC2VY6) if you use this API. This endpoint is authenticated with a normal Dune API key.

# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor-based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
