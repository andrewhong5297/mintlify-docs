<Note>
This beta endpoint is currently only available in our dev environment: https://activity.dev.dunetech.io
</Note>

The Activity endpoint provides a real-time feed of on-chain activity for any EVM address, including token transfers (native, ERC20, ERC721), contract interactions, and transaction details.

<Note>
  - This endpoint is authenticated with a normal Dune API key
  - Activity is returned in chronological order, with newest items first
  - Supports multiple token standards:
    - Native token transfers
    - ERC20 token transfers with token metadata (symbol, decimals)
    - ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
  - Contract interactions include decoded function calls and parameters
  - Human-readable descriptions are provided
</Note>

# Ordering

The data is ordered by descending block time, so that new activity will always be delivered first.

# Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
