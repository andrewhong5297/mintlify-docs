description: Mint Dashboards on Dune to Support Wizards
---

The best way to support wizards is to mint their dashboards on Dune. We've built an integration with Zora to mint any "moment" from a Dashboard. Mints cost 0.000777 ETH (roughly $2).

You can mint by going to a dashboard and clicking the blue "mint" button in the top right.

## Minting a Moment

When you click mint, you'll see this modal popup. The key interactions are labeled below:

You'll have to connect your Ethereum wallet, if you don't have one yet you can install [Metamask](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) and then fill it with ETH from Coinbase or some other onramp. **Minting occurs on Base, so make sure to [transfer your ETH to Base to mint](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/base).**

After you select an amount and click mint, Dune will take a screenshot and create the token on Zora for you to mint. This may take 5-10 seconds, but you will then see a prompt in your wallet that looks like this:

This is showing you the number of tokens you will recieve, and how much ETH you are spending + gas fees. After you confirm, it should only take a second before you see a successful mint screen:

Congrats - you've now saved an onchain moment in an onchain momento forever! Thank you for supporting the community at Dune.
