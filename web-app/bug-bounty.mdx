title: "Bug Bounty"
description: "Found a security issue within our application?"
---

If you believe you have discovered a security issue within our web application or API, we highly encourage you to report it to us. We appreciate the efforts of ethical hackers and reward those who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

Please submit any vulnerability or bug discovered via this form: https://forms.gle/NTK3FGMYRsAWKkY4A

We do not accept email submissions of vulnerabilities. All reports must go through the form above to ensure they are tracked and processed appropriately.

We aim to review and respond to submissions within 14 days. While we understand your eagerness to hear back, emailing us for updates will not speed up the review process. We appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work through each submission thoroughly.

We value transparency and will work with you to resolve any legitimate issues found. Your efforts help us maintain the security and trustworthiness of our platform. Thank you for your contribution to our security.

The rubric we use to determine bug bounties is as follows:

| Level       | Example                                                                                                          | Maximum Bug Bounty |

| 5. Critical | Unauthorized ability to execute arbitrary code on the server- Exploiting API endpoints to access restricted data | Up to $10,000      |
| 4. High     | SQL injection leading to data exfiltration- Bypassing authentication mechanisms                                  | Up to $5,000       |
| 3. Medium   | Cross-site scripting (XSS)- CSRF that affects user accounts                                                      | Up to $2,000       |

### Duplicate Submissions Policy
We value all security research, but we do not provide rewards for submissions that cover known issues already reported by other researchers or internally identified by our team. If your report is a duplicate, we will notify you of the status and appreciate your effort, but no bounty will be issued.

### Expectations for Security Researchers

- **Ethical Conduct:** We expect all participants to adhere to the highest standards of ethical, good-faith behavior.
- **Responsible Reporting:** Report findings directly to us via the designated form and provide sufficient details to reproduce and address the issue. Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before giving us the opportunity to resolve them.
- **Minimize Harm:** Perform all testing in a manner that minimizes potential harm or disruption to our users and services.
- **No Social Engineering:** Do not engage in social engineering or phishing attack on our users or employees.
- **No Unauthorized Access to Data:** Do not access, modify, or delete data that does not belong to you. Use separate test accounts.
