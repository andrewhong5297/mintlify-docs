Dune's operations largely rely on a credit system. This guide will explain the concept of credits, their consumption, and management.

## Introduction
### What are credits?
Credits are the key to accessing a wide range of functions on the Dune platform. Whether you're delving into data queries or simply exploring dashboards, knowing how credits operate is crucial.

### Why are credits important?
All actions on Dune, from running complex data queries to simply refreshing your view to see the latest insights, consume credits. It's vital for every user, viewer, or creator alike, to be mindful of their credit usage.

## Your Credit Allocation
### üéüÔ∏è Monthly Credit Allowance
- **Set Number of Credits:** Each month, your subscription plan provides a set allotment of credits.
- **Top-Up:** Run out of credits? Our 'pay as you go' option lets you add more anytime, ensuring your work is always in flow.
### üîÑ Rollover Policy
- **Monthly Refresh:** Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle; they do not roll over to the next month.
- **Maximize Use:** Plan your activities to maximize the utility of your credits.
### üë• Team Accounts
- **Collective Pool:** All team members draw from a shared pot of credits. Sync up to make the most of your resources.
