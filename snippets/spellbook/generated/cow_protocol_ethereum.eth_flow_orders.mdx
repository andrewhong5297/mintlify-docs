## cow_protocol_ethereum.eth_flow_orders 
ETHFlow enables the sale of Native ETH via CoW Protocol. This works essentially by placing an (onchain) order,  through the ETHFlow contract (https://github.com/cowprotocol/ethflowcontract) sending native which then wraps  the asset as an ERC20. The order is filled through this intermediary contract that uses ERC1271 signature  verification to place the order on the user&#x27;s behalf.
